# 🌟 Star Dataset Visualization

> A data visualization project focused on exploring and understanding the properties and classification of stars using various visualization techniques in Python.

## 📁 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a **group academic project** by a team of 4. Our main objective was to explore the **Star Dataset**, understand the relationship between different attributes (e.g., Equitorial Coordinates, Galactic Longitude, Galactic Latitude etc), and create meaningful visual representations to derive insights.

The project consists of:

* A **Google Colab Notebook** for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
* A **CSV file** containing the dataset.
* A **PowerPoint presentation** summarizing our findings and visualizations.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

* `Equatorial Coordinates` 
* `Galactic Longitude` 
* `Galactic Latitude` 
* `Absolute Magnitude`
* `Visual Magnitude` 
* `Absolute Magnitude` 
* `Parallax	` 
* `Error`
* `Distance (ly)` 


We used publicly available star classification data to build this dataset.

## 📌 Objectives

* Explore and clean the dataset.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Visualize important trends and patterns.
* Identify correlations between variables.
* Classify stars based on Equatorial Coordinates , Galactic Longitude , Galactic Latitude , Absolute Magnitude , Visual Magnitude etc.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* Python
* Google Colab
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Plotly (for interactive plots)

---

## 📈 Visualizations Implemented


* Bar charts
* Interactive graphs (using matplotlib)
* Color-coded plots based on star types/spectral classes

## 💡 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** or download the files.
2. Open `Star_Dataset_Visualization.ipynb` in **Google Colab** or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Ensure the `star_data.csv` is in the same directory or adjust the file path in the notebook.
4. Run the notebook cell by cell to explore data and visualizations.

## 🖼️ Presentation

The PowerPoint presentation file summarizes:

* The methodology
* Key visualizations
* Observations and conclusions

It was created for our final submission and oral presentation.
